track #0
--------

daily activity
just look in the raw (non-stats) requests

track #1
--------

classify each session as to what happened in any requests
annotate requests (length, other params)
-> see which users involved in a session
	if one: done!
	if none: anonymous
	if multiple: split session! (or filter out)



session management
    associate sessions with users


Daten Denis FrieÃŸ

extract sessions
Read user databases!
	actions by time
	user stats by user attributes (faculty / status)
	by badges
new action: posting a proposal

ip
user agents
performance data
average reading time per user
new action: vote behavior
usage by time

filter out our devs
Email bounce / Out of office stats?

try saving requests as protobuf
write load_requests to load data from apache log

does setting a password correlate with user activity, user platform, status group, faculty?
performance correlate

Activity
	-> Diversity (where)
	Reading
		Number of threads
		Length
	Writing
		Quality
		Length
	Voting
		Do they change how they vote
			-> Can we detect why (with a diff)
			How often
request paths, how do people navigate

activity by date
activity by time

who sorted?
how long on site?
	break down by
		frontsite
		overview
		comments
		writing
		other
		(get all of that by user, and by average of average over user)
parse performance data
details
	.. by faculty
	.. by user activity


Rothe
	diffs between proposals

define generic solution for working with db and / or JSON and / or protobuf
	helper methods instead of SQL
